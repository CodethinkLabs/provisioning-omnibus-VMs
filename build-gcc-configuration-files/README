Instructions to build gcc manually (no omnibus package)
======================================================

You will need gmp, mpfr and mpc to build gcc and then tell gcc where to find it
building the omnibus package will do this for you (remembers that this will build
gcc too but we are looking for developing and testing gcc in a separate tree):

  git clone https://github.com/CodethinkLabs/omnibus-codethink-toolchain.git
  cd omnibus-codethink-toolchain
  omnibus build codethink-toolchain --override base_dir:./local workers:8

After gathering all the required packages we need to tell gcc where these packages are
and for that we will need to use the gcc-configure-sourceme file:

  git clone https://github.com/CodethinkLabs/gcc.git
  cd gcc
  git checkout codethink/$BRANCH_TO_BUILD
  cd /home/rpm_omnibus/build-gcc
  source gcc-configure-sourceme
  ../gcc/configure --prefix=/home/rpm_omnibus/build-gcc --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran --with-pkgversion=codethink-toolchain --disable-bootstrap --disable-nls
  make -j 8

If you would like to run gcc tests, after building you can run
  make -j 8 check (make -k check will remove the issue of not having autogen)
